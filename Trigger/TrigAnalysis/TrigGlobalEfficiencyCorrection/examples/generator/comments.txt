   Simple example: single electron or single muon trigger, using different 
configurations for 2015 and 2016.

   Another example: combination of single-lepton, dielectron and dimuon
triggers, using different configurations for 2015 and 2016, and illustrating
how to fill the property 'ListOfLegsPerTool'.

[example2] ###################################################################
   Similar to example 1 (combination of single-lepton, dielectron and dimuon
triggers), but showing how to use different triggers in different data-taking
periods, and how to modify some of the trigger pT thresholds.

[example3com] ################################################################
   The set of examples 3a - 3e illustrates the use of lepton selection tags
for various scenarios:

- Example 3a: trigger = 2e12_lhloose_L12EM10VH, selecting events containing
              >=2 loose electrons, the leading-pT electron always satisfying
              in addition tight PID+isolation requirements.

- Example 3b: trigger = e24_lhmedium_L1EM20VH_OR_e60_lhmedium_OR_e120_lhloose
                        || 2e12_lhloose_L12EM10VH
              selecting events with >=2 loose electrons where the leading-pT
              electron also satisfies medium PID requirements.
              Only the latter is allowed to fire the single-electron trigger.

- Example 3c: trigger = e24_lhmedium_L1EM20VH_OR_e60_lhmedium_OR_e120_lhloose
                        || 2e12_lhloose_L12EM10VH
              selecting events with >=2 loose electrons. Any electron also
              satisfying medium PID requirements is allowed to fire the
              single-electron trigger.

- Example 3d: trigger = 2e17_lhvloose_nod0 || e7_lhmedium_nod0_mu24
      || e26_lhtight_nod0_ivarloose_OR_e60_lhmedium_nod0_OR_e140_lhloose_nod0
              same type of selection as example 3c but with 3 PID working
              points, using two distinct decorations.

- Example 3e: same scenario as example 3d, but using an alternative
              implementation that requires only one decoration.

[example3a] ##################################################################
   For this example (3a), one needs to set up two versions of the electron
trigger tools: one configured for offline tight PID+isolation, to be used for
the leading electron, and another configured for offline loose PID, to be
used for subleading electrons.

   The configuration of the TrigGlobalEfficiencyCorrectionTool then involves 
filling two additional properties, 'ListOfTagsPerTool' and
'LeptonTagDecorations'. We also fill a third one, 'ElectronLegsPerTag';
it isn't required but still advised as the tool can then perform further
consistency checks of its configuration.",  

   The leading electron will always be tagged with a 'Signal' decoration
(decorated value set to 1), while subleading electrons are never tagged 
(-> decorated value set to 0).
   Since efficiencies provided by CP tools are inclusive, one should NEVER
 tag the subleading leptons as 'Signal', even if they satisfy the tight PID
+ isolation requirements; doing so would bias the results.
   See example 3c that deals with a more complicate situation requiring
handling multiple PID levels for all leptons.

[example3b] ##################################################################
   For this example (3b), one needs to set up three versions of the electron
trigger tools: two configured for offline tight PID+isolation, to be used for
the leading electron (one for the trigger leg e24_xxx, another for the leg
e12_xxx), and another configured for offline loose PID (for the leg e12_xxx)
to be used for subleading electrons.

   The configuration of the TrigGlobalEfficiencyCorrectionTool is very similar
to the example 3a (e.g. the decoration of electrons is identical), please
refer to that example for more details.
   Here, in addition, one needs to let the tool know, via the property
'ListOfLegsPerTag', that only 'Signal'-tagged electrons are allowed to fire
the e24_xxx leg.

[example3c] ##################################################################
   For this example (3c), any electron might be tagged as 'Signal' if it
passes MediumLH selection (here emulated with a random number). Electron tools
providing the efficiency/SF for the e24_xxx leg are configured with the
MediumLH working point. For the tools providing efficiency/SF for the e12_xxx
leg however, one SHOULD NOT set up one version for 'Medium'-tagged electrons
and another version for untagged electrons. This is because for the latter
one would need to configure the tools for a LooseLH-but-not-MediumLH working
point, which is not provided by egamma. Instead, we use a single version,
configured with the LooseLH working point, and instruct the TrigGlob tool to
use that version for both 'Medium'-tagged and untagged electrons. In this way,
no bias is introduced. ",
   The configuration of the TrigGlobalEfficiencyCorrectionTool is otherwise
essentially the same as for the example 3b, please refer to that example for
more details.
    
[example3d] ##################################################################
   We use two decorations, 'MyMedium' and 'MyTight'
Note that the TrigGlob tool considers only one single tag per electron. When
an electron has >=2 non-zero decorations (e.g. 'MyMedium' + 'MyTight'),
the tag associated to the electron by the tool is chosen as the first one
appearing in the list of decorations provided in the 'LeptonTagDecorations'
property.
    
[example3e] ##################################################################
   We use a single decoration named 'PID', and rely on the decorated value to
indicate whether the electron passes TightLH PID + isolation (=> value = 2)
or only MediumLH PID (=> value = 1). The TrigGlob tool then forms tags
by suffixing the decorated value to the decoration name, i.e. 'PID1' and
'PID2'. One must then use the latter tags in the properties 'ListOfLegsPerTag'
and 'ListOfTagsPerTool'.
