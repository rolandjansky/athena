# TrigInDetConfig

The code in this packages is essentially just the python code for the configuration of the Inner Detector Trigger.

As such, the user should refer directly to the README file from the 
[Trigger/TrigTools/TrigInDetConfig/python](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/-/blob/master/Trigger/TrigTools/TrigInDetConfig/python) 
directory
