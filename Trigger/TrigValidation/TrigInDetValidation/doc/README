TrigInDetValidation
-------------------
This contains everything you need to run and test the IDTrigger in the RTT

The directory structure is 

  share      -   py job options files for running the RTT processing
  test       -   global TestConfiguration xml file for running the jobs in the RTT
  TIDAbuild  -   xml fragments and makefile to build the global xml file
  utils      -   useful utilities to allow testing the xml jobs 
  doc        -   this documantation


Making the xml file
-------------------
In the 

   TIDAbuild

directory, there are separate small xml fragments for individual jobs to be 
run in the RTT, for example ...

  TrigInDetValidation_bjet_IBL_pu40_run2.xml
  TrigInDetValidation_bjet_IBL_pu40_run2_newSeeding.xml
  TrigInDetValidation_bjet_IBL_pu40_run2_oldSeeding.xml
  ...

also in the build directory, is a makefile and a master file 

  TrigInDetValidation_TestConfiguration_main.xml

which simply includes all the separate xml fragments to make the large

  test/TrigInDetValidation_TestConfiguration.xml

xml file for the RTT.

Do NOT edit this large xml file directly - instead modify the xml fragments
and then run 

  make 

in the build directory.

This also tests the xml integrity of the file.

NB: Because we use the c preprocessor to compine the xml fragments, then 
    the pattern /* as used in say the "<keepPattern>" entries for 
    directories, eg

       <keepFilePattern>TIDAWeb/build/*</keepFilePattern> 
  
    is recognised as the "open comment" tag, requiring a later "*/" close 
    comment. For this reason, if needing this construct, use "/STAR" rather 
    then "/*" since we 

      #define STAR *

    so the preprocessor creates these patterns for us, and they are not then 
    interpretted as the open comments     


Data samples
-------------

The different data samples to run on are stored in the 

  TIDAbuild/samples 

directory. The different data samples should be used by 

 #include

statements in the xml fragment for the relevant job.       

Utilsities for testing
----------------------

in the 

  utils

directory there are two utilities ...

  mkargs
  mkdatasets

These take the xml fragments and write out ...

  mkdatasets -  a pythion fragment to be included in job options to run exactly 
                the data set that is used in the xml file  
  mkargs     -  a shell script containing the commands that need to be executed 
                to run the complete RTT tasks, with tasks for the different 
                "positions" in the RTT job sequence, with the correct arguments
                the script also includes the relevant "get_files" calls to ensure
                that all the relevant files that would be fetched by the RTT are
                retrieved

The script mkargs calls the mkdatasets script, so you do not need to use mkdatasets
itself, unless you are only interested in the py jo fragment.

Both scripts can be executed from the utils directory as follows ...

   mkargs ../build

which will create py fragments and shell scripts for all xml job files  in the 

  ../build directory  

Running as 
  
  mkargs ../build/*.xml

will run for all the xml files matching the pattern etc. This is also try for the 

  mkdatasets 

script. 

Rather than try to run the script directly, which may not work,  you should edit 
it, or simply cut and paste the commands to ru nthe stages that you require.


Finishing up
------------

To build the full, large xml configuration file ...

  test/TrigInDetValidation_TestConfiguration.xml

you need to run 

make 

in the TIDAbuild directory.

This also runs the xml checker to ensure that there are no xml syntax errors 
in main file
