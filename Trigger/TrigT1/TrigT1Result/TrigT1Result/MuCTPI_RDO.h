 *
 *   @short Class representing the readout data of the MuCTPI hardware and simulation
 *
 *          The MuCTPI hardware and the simulation can send all the muon candidates
 *          recevied in a maximal window spanning +-2 BCs around the triggered BC 
 *          (giving a window of maximally 5 BCs) together with the muon multiplicities
 *          in the same window to the readout system. This class represents the ROD
 *          fragment generated by the MuCTPI to Athena.
 *
 *          For a detailed description of the data format of the MuCTPI, see
 *          the MIROD documentation (https://edms.cern.ch/file/248757/1/mirod.pdf).
