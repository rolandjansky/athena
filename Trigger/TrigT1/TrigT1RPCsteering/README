This package contains the main algorithm which performs the Barrel Level-1 muon
trigger simulation. The production of the trigger signal with the related 
Level-1 RoI, and the communication of these data up to the muCTPI are handled.


Basic Components:

TrigT1RPC         : ATHENA algorithm class that implements the main sequence
                    for the Level-1 barrel simulation.




Use and configuration in ATHENA:

    * Load and use the required DLL module with the following command lines:

       ApplicationMgr.Dlls += { "TrigT1RPCsteering" };
       ApplicationMgr.TopAlg = { "TrigT1RPC" };

    * The steering needs all the other packages inside the branch TrigT1RPC.
      As a consequences all the configuration steps for those packages must be
      followed (i.e. links to configuration files, input of configuration 
      parametrs).

    * Configuration parameters:

      FastDebug  [0]  unsigned int for selective debug of the fast simulation
      Monitoring [0]  unsigned int for selective debug of the monitoring

      DetailedParameters  [false]  switch for computing the cabling + TW
      RPCbytestream       [false]  switch for activating the byte stream prod.
      RPCbytestreamFile   [""]     file name on which the byte stream is dump.
