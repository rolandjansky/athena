This package contains the classes for modelling the data flow from the RPC
detector trought the Level-1 electronics. There is also a bare implementation 
of the trigger logic, that will provide a fast Level-1 simulation algo to be 
used into the Level-2 data pre-processing. The complete functionalities of the 
Level-1 electronics are implemented into the package TrigT1RPChardware. Two 
sets of libraries are created: TrigT1RPCsteering to be used into ATHENA 
framework and RPCsteering to be used for running a standalone application.


Basic Components:

RPCtrigDataObject : Base class from which the classes managing data are 
                    inerithed.

RPCdata           : Base container holding the RPC digits, and providing access
                    to them.

RPCsimuData       : Specialization of the RPCdata container that implements the
                    stroring/retrieving of the Muontecarlo truth associated to
                    the RPCdigits.

RPCdigits         : Basic class that holds the physics information coming from
                    an RPC hit (signal time plus the space position of the hit)
                    and provides also methods which supports the retrieving of
                    informations related to the hit (geometry of the chamber,
                    Montecarlo truth).

RPCsimuDigit      : Specialization of the RPCdigits class implementing the 
                    access to the Montecarlo truth data.

MuonSimuTrack     : Class storing the Montecarlo truth (i.e. the muon track
                    parameters.   

CMAdata           : Container holding the input bit patterns to the Coincidence
                    Matrix. It manages the replica mechanism of the RPC digits 
                    (on the confirm stations) into different input partterns 
                    for the CMA and provides also the interface versus the PAD
                    container.

CMApatterns       : Holds the six input patterns to the CMA, and provide the
                    infrastructure for applying the Level-1 logic on data. It
                    manages also the iconfiguration and the transmission of 
                    data to the detailed simulation of the hardware.

CMAtrigger        : Class modelling the trigger signals from the Coincidence
                    Matrices.

bitPATTERN        : Models the input pattern to the CMA implementing some  
                    bit-wise operations. The connection between a raised bit 
                    and the RPCdigit from which it come, is provided too.

CMAreadout        : Interface class between the Matrix class (emulating the CMA
                    electronics) and the MatrixReadOut class (emulating the CMA
                    readout). It provides the infrastructure for filling, 
                    retrieving and storing the byte stream data chunck related 
                    to the CMA.

PADreadout        : Interface class between the MatrixReadOut class and the 
                    PadreadOut class (emulating the readout of the PAD. It 
                    provides the infrastructure for filling, retrieving and 
                    storing the byte stream data chunck related to the PAD.

RPCbytestream     : Class managing the production and the access to the RPC
                    bytestream.




Use and configuration in ATHENA:

    * Load and use the required DLL module with the following command lines:

       ApplicationMgr.Dlls += { "TrigT1RPClogic" };

    * The logic package needs the TrigT1RPChardware package to be built.

    * There is no Configuration parameters:
