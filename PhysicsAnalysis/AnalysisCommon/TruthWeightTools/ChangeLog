	* TruthWeightTools-01-04-02
	* More modifications to CMakeLists.txt by Kurt Brendlinger and James Robinson

	* TruthWeightTools-01-04-01
	* Modifications to CMakeLists.txt by Kurt Brendlinger to make compatible with AnalysisBase

2017-04-05 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-04-00
	* Changed names of accessors: QCD uncertatinites only relevant to ggF now called
	*   ggF_qcd_XXX
	* Removed lines from example code added by mistake
	* Version intened for Summer 2017 analysis - contains WG1 recommendation for ggF
	* Namely: ggF_qcd_2017

2017-03-26 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-03-00
	* Contains Higgs ggF QCD uncertainty weights as discussed at
	* https://indico.cern.ch/event/618048/
	* Four uncertainty schemes: qcd_wg1_*, qcd_stxs, qcd_2017, qcd_jve
	* qcd_2017 is recommended. The other can be used for cross checks

2017-03-10 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-05
	* Added two new features
	* 1. RequireFinite - sets weights to nominal weight if not finite
	* 2. WeightCutOff - sets any weight to this value if larger
	* This helps a lot against events with crazy weights
	* Added finalize method that summarizes weight information
	* See slides at this HComb meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/617739/

2017-03-07 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-04
	* Fixed bug affecting the TruthWeightTool (and Higgs tool in AUTO mode) when running over many files
	* Slightly improved print() message of HiggsWeights
	* Added two more weights qcd_nnlops_nnlo, qcd_nnlops_pow
	* Extended HiggsWeightTest executable to produce many more histograms for uncertainty evaluation
	* Extended evaluateHiggsThoryUncert.C macro to make plots of evaluated uncertainty
	* Output from macro seem yield reasonable results, however also revealed problem with weights in samples
	  https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ATLMCPROD-4449
	* Added macro to analyze HNNLO input templates used for the Powehg NNLOPS generation

2017-03-03 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-03
	* Added example macro to evaluate Higgs theory uncertainties
	* All results produced so far makes sense! (mostly)
	* Central values, PDF uncertainties, alphaS. Didn't check QCD yet..

2017-03-02 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-02
	* All PDF weighs now read in to HiggsWeight struct, both to
	*  1. reweight to a differnet PDF (central value) and
	*  2. assess uncertainty using the error sets of PDF4LHC and NNPDF3.0
	* Test exectuable now
	* 1. accesses proper STXS obserables if existing in input file
	* 2. produce histograms in output files (Higgs pT, yH, Njets, STXS spectra)

2017-03-02 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-01
	* Support for forcing expected structure for Run-2 default VBF and VH sampels (W+H, W-H, ZH)
	* Better error handling (code did not abort as intended when something was wrong)

2017-03-01 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.h>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-00
	* First version of HiggsWeightTool as announced on today's HComb meeeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/616388/
	* Improvements for Athena users by Will Buttinger (Thanks!):
	  Even if the input file doesn't have the TruthMetaData, the tool will access the athena-only IOVMetaData
	* Note: this is still a beta-version, no full validation done yet (although output values look reasonable)

2017-02-27 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.ch>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-01-00
	* Test exe that works in athena - but only in classAccess mode since TruthMetaData POOL converter missing
	* AsgMetaDataTool need to call sysInitialze rather than initialize to be registred in tool svc
	* Many thanks to Will Buttinger for help

2017-02-24 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.ch>
	* Adding a few more user friendly methods to the TruthWeightTool

2017-02-22 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.ch>
	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-00-00

2017-02-19 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.ch>
	* Moving Tobias Bisanz' TruthWeightTool from Generators/GenAnalysisTools/TruthTools to this package (PhysicsAnalysis/TruthWeightTools) since its intended for physics analysis
