A tool for inclusive secondary vertex reconstruction in ATLAS ID.

This is an improved version of the VrtSecInclusive algorithm.

Changes with respect to original version:

1) Outdated Graph(CERNLIB) package is replaced by Bron&Kerbosch algorithm from BOOST
2) Fake(fragmentation+pileup) and hadronic interaction vertices are removed using a dedicated MVA
3) Additional material interaction rejection is based on the TrackingGeometry material layers
4) Many improvements in vertex topology resolution
5) One-track vertices are allowed (e.g. 3 track system, where one track crosses 2 others in different places, 
     so that 3-track vertex has inacceptable Chi2, will be resolved as 2-track + 1-track vertices).
     This allows to get 2 vertices in case of e.g. cascade B->D decay with 3 reconstracted tracks in total.
6) Algorithm is converted to Tool for convenience of usage in other Algorithms.
7) Several tool configurations suitable for different problems are provided, e.g.:
        SoftBFinderTool         - targeting Soft b-tagging for SUSY
	InclusiveBFinderTool    - inclusive B-hadron decay reconstruction (a la CMS/D0) for b-tagging
	DVFinderTool            - search for displaced vertices produced by exotic particles  


Configured finders:
1) SoftBFinderTool       - looks for all low-pt (>1GeV) B-hadron vertices in event. No jet presence is assumed
2) InclusiveBFinderTool  - looks for all B-hadron vertices in event with low fake rate. 
                           Suitable for ttbar and other processes with similar pt-range.
3) HighPtBFinderTool     - looks for all high-pt B-hadron vertices in event. No jet presence is assumed.
4) MaterialSVFinderTool  - looks for hadronic interaction vertices in detector material.
5) DVFinderTool          - looks for heavy displaced vertices in ID volume.
