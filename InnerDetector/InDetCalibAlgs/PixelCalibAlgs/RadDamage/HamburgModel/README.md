The code in data_processing.cpp is a c++ implementation of the Hamburg model of radiation damage. It calculates the effective doping concentration based on an introduction of stable/decaying acceptors and the removal of donors due to irradiation. Moreover, it handles the annealing processes depending in the temperature. According to the effective doping concentration, the depletion voltage is calculated.
Besides the depletion voltage, the leakage current (inclusive alpha parameter) is calculated based on the Hamburg model. Again, leakage current increase due to irradiation and decrease due to annealing is handled. Two different options for the temperature averaging are available (use_CMS_paper_alpha0).

In order to simulate all of these properties, a profile of irradiation dose and temperature is necessary. The profile has to have the following format:

duration (in seconds!!!!!!!!!, integer) / temperature in K (float) / dose rate in neq/cm2s (integer !)

Different examples are available in the temp_rad_data folder. Besides that, a program to create new profiles from two given temperature and irradiation profiles is available in this folder (help included in the cpp file).

As a prerequisite make sure that Root (for plotting, tested with version 6.06) and Boost (for Date handling, tested with version 1.62) as well as a c++ 11 compatible compiler are installed. Now, the program can be compiled with:

g++ data_processing.cpp -I /path/to/boost/boost_1_62_0 -Wall -std=c++11 -o output `root-config --cflags` `root-config --libs`

After compilation the program can be called with:

./output temp_rad_data/my_profile.txt

By default, a variety of pdf files is generated and all corresponding root histograms are stored in a single root file. Furthermore, by default, the pdf files will be overwritten and the histograms will be added to the existing root file - this can be changed in the first lines of the code, a unique naming scheme based on the system clock is available!

Some variables might be changed in the first part of the code, apart from that, no adaptions should be necessary.

Attention:  
1.duration in the profile file HAS to be dividable by global timestep (parameter in the code, default=1) ->Integer result required for the ratio of duration and global time step

2.profile file may not have additional (even/especially empty) lines after the last line or in the beginning

3.the value for the global_layer_conversion has to be changed in order to fit to another layer (parameter transforms luminosity in neq) eg: B-Layer: 2.5e12, IBL 6e12

4.due to some computational reasons the final luminosity might not be correct. The fluence (in neq/cm2) however, should be exact.

5. to change from one detector type to another (e.g. for a different layer in the detector), change mainly 3 things: thickness (200 for IBL and 250 for PIXEL) and global_layer_conversion (global values) and Ndonor (different for PIXEL and IBL)
