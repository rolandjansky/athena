@page MuonIdHelpersAlgs_page Compact Identifier tests

 - This package was designed to test the compact identifiers and to do timing tests on the packing and 
unpacking of identifiers. The detector elements and the readout channel identifiers are checked: the 
algorithm reads in some data and accesses the identifiers from the muon digits. Then various tests are done 
on each identifier. This package was very important and used when the Muons migrated to the compact 
identifiers. It might still be used in the future in case significant modifications occur in the design and 
implementation of identifiers.
