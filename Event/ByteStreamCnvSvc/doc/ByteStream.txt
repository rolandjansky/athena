	Byte Stream Conversion Service and Converters.

	ByteStream conversion Service (ByteStreamCnvSvc) provides a means to
convert the raw data in the ByteStream format to and from the transient 
representation, Raw Data Objects (RDO).   In Gaudi's terminology, ByteStream
can be considered as a persistency for reading and storing raw data. In 
practice, the source of the ByteStream can be a file, or the online data 
source (or its emulation) through network, for example.   Together with the 
IdentifiableContainer, used to contain the Raw Data Objects, ByteStreamCnvSvc
provides a mechanism for creating the RDOs on demand.

	 In the current scheme, where the event data comes from MC
simulation, the raw data objects are output of the simulation, including 
noise and pileup addition as well as ROD emulation. To use the 
ByteStreamCnvSvc for a particular detector, the RDO and its Collection 
and Container classes have to be defined and  implemented.  
The RDOs should be stored in Collection classes, and 
the Collections are stored in  IdentifiableContainer<Collection>.   
See the separate notes on how to  implement the Collection and how to use 
IdentifiableContainer. 

---- Packages  and related Documentation

    There are two basic packages for ByteStream, 

Event/ByteStreamData
Event/ByteStreamCnvSvc

ByteStreamData:
	
	The Atlas raw event format is defined in eformat package in 
DataCollection release.   The first version of ByteStreamCnvSvc used a 
older implementation of event format.  The new implementation using 
eformat is developed after release 4.1.0 .   The offline software accesses 
the DataCollection  release through an interface package, 
External/DataCollection .

	eformat package defines the raw event data in terms of fragments, 
starting from FullEvent, to SubDetector, ROS, ROB and ROD.  
In addition, the data can be stored in different storage type, such as 
RawMemory or File.   In the package ByteStreamData, we define two typedefs.
RawEvent   == FullEventFragment (in RawMemoryStorageType ), and 
ByteStream == RawMemoryStorageType (a block a memory for holding the event). 
  
        RawEvent is used in the conversion process, and ByteStream is what we 
store in Transient store if we want to store the ByteStream data in the 
transient  store (or eventually to persistency). 
 
	Note that the event format related things are defined in 

"The Event Format in the ATLAS DAQ/EF Prototype-1" ATL-DAQ-98-129
(there is an updated version)
    
There is a well defined identifier (raw event Source ID),  consisting of a 
32 bit word.  The unsigned integer is used to store this 32 bit word.
The identifier is divided into three fields.  Each detector group is 
responsible for defining the module ID field. 

ByteStreamCnvSvc package implements the necessary classes for a
Gaudi conversion service.   See the Athena Developer Guide V 2.0.2, 
Chapter 15 for the general description of conversion service and converter.
While a concrete conversion service provides infrastructure for reading and
writing to and from a particular persistency, the converters are responsible
for converting a particular data type to and from persistency. 

Each subdetector should have a Converter package that provides the converters
for the raw data objects.  For example, for LAr, there is 
LArCalorimeter/LArCnv/LArByteStream package, which provides converters for
LArRawChannelCollection and LArRawChannelContainer.   RDOs are stored in 
Collections, and the  Collections are accessed through  Container (subclass of 
IdentifiableContainer<T>).  Both Collection and Container are Athena data 
objects in the Transient Store.  For each sub-detector, there has to be a 
converter for the Collection and a converter for the Container.

The essential part of a converter is the two basic virtual methods:
createObj(IOpaqueAddress*,  DataObject*&)
createRep(DataObject*, IOpaqueAddress*& )
 
The first one creates a DataObject from persistent information, captured in
IOpaqueAddress, and the second is supposed to write the DataObject to 
a persistent representation. 

IOpaqueAddress is an interface class for passing persistent information
in the conversion process.  Each persistency technology implements a concrete
address class.  In this case, it is ByteStreamAddress. 
ByteStreamAddress's baseclass contains a CLID, two 
strings and two integers.   CLID is used by Gaudi service to call the 
appropriate converter for the data class, while the other variables can be 
used to carry information about this particular instance. 
In addition, ByteStreamAddress class containers a vector of ROB identifiers. 
These can be used to retrieve ROB data from ROBDataProviderSvc. 

     The basic fragment of ByteStream is ROD fragment.  To help assemble 
all the ROD fragments from all sub-detectors into a ByteStream, a helper class
FullEventAssembler, is provided.   Given a list of ROD data, each associated 
with a ROBID, the assembler class can put together an Event Fragment, 
provided the mapping from ROBID to upper level ID is given through another 
class ( a simple mapping class, SrcIdMap, is provided in ByteStreamCnvSvc 
package, but it really depends how the RODIDs are defined) .

--- Writing RDOs to ByteStream ( createRep method ) :

     At end of an event, after all RDOs are created in transient store, 
the conversion service will be called.  ByteStreamCnvSvc will first create
a RawEvent instance, then all the converters will be called to fill 
the RawEvent instance with all the ROD objects.  The RawEvent instance can be
accessed by 'const RawEvent* ByteStreamCnvSvc::getRawEvent()' method. 

    The converter for the Container should convert all the RDO data in the 
Collections into ByteStream,  while the createRep method of the converter
for the Collection need not be implemented, and should not be called.

	The jobOptions for the OutputStream should be configured to 
persistify only the Container (and not the Collection object) in 
the transient store.

--- Creating RDOs from ByteStream (createObj method ) 

    The creation of RDOs has to follow the requirement that they should be
created only on demand.    Therefore, the createObj method of the 
Collection has to be implemented.

  For reading the ByteStream data, there is a interface class 
ByteStreamInputSvc, which defines the methods for getting the 
RawEvent from a source.  The concrete service (ByteStreamFileInputSvc, 
for example) is implemented for a specific data source(from a binary file, 
in this case).  There could be  ByteStreamTranInputSvc, for example, to get 
the ByteStream data from transient data store.

   The current Athena requires each data input source to implement the 
EventSelctor/EventIterator interface.  EventSelectorByteStream locates a 
ByteStreamInputSvc using a service whose name is specified in the jobOptions.
This way, EventSelectorByteStream does not have dependency on the concrete 
service. EventSelectorByteStream::next() reads in the next event
by calling ByteStreamInputSvc::nextEvent.  In 
EventSelectorByteStream::reference(), an address object is created for 
EventInfo, as required by the framework.   In addition, a set of 
RawEventAddress objects will be created according to a predefined list. 
See BS_TDSItems class. 
These address objects will be registered in the StoreGate. 
The list should contain the CLID and the name of the objects. 
Most likely, these will include the top level container of the RDOs that we 
have converters for, and know how to create out of the ByteStream.
The address object created for the Container has no information other than
the CLID and the name of the Container. 
This hardwired list has to be expanded when a new detector is included.

  When the container object is accessed through the transient store, 
the container converter will  be called. It is the responsibility of the 
container converter to create the entries in StoreGate for the collections.   
The container converter should have access to map for 
associating each  Collection with a set of ROBid.  With these ROBid, a  
ByteStreamAddress  object can be created, and recorded in StoreGate. 
In addition, we require the hash index for the Collection be stored in
the ByteStreamAddress.  If each ROB is for a few collections, then you may 
use other variables to indicate the sub-components in the ROB.  There are two
integer and one string variables in IOpaqueAddress that we can use for that 
purpose.  The string variable is used as the name of the object, and 
the first int parameter is the hash index, and the second int parameter
can be used to carry additional information. 

	 For efficiency purpose, it is probably desirable to decode a ROB
once, and create all the collections that corresponds to this ROB.  These 
additional Collections created in the process  can be sent to StoreGate  
with this method:   
StoreGate::updateProxy(CLID, Key, DataObject*).   
( We can not use the  regular StoreGate::record method because there is 
already an entry made for this CLID/Key.... CHECK ....). 

	The converter for the Collection should be a template class for 
ROBDataProvider.  The converter class first gets the ROBids from 
ByteStreamAddress, then using these ROBid, to get ROBData from 
ROBDataProvider.    The ROBDataProvider is a template because
the online and offline data source can be very different, and 
ROBData class has different StorageType in online and offline context.

	The templated converter class should be specialized with a concrete
ROBDataProvider.  For example, RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc is provided in 
ByteStreamCnvSvc package for offline.    The specialized converter class
should have the appropriate Gaudi factory entries in a component shared 
library.   The correspond specialized converter class should be made in 
a similar, but separate, shared library.

------  Converter implementation
	
	To separate infrastructure part of the conversion from the detector
specific part, a template Collection  converter is provided in 
ByteStreamCnvSvc package.  Detector software  developers are only required 
to provide components for the conversion as defined below.  
 
  template <typename RDP, class TOOL > 
  class CollectionByteStreamCnv: public Converter {
  // ... 
  };
  
  RDP:   ROBDataProviderSvc.  The offline version is RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc
	 in ByteStreamCnvSvc.  
	 Requirements:
	  1) Gaudi Service class.
	  2) typedef for ROBFragment and ROBData
	     (for example, 
	       typedef EventFormat::RawMemory::ROBFragment ROBFragment ; 
	       typedef EventFormat::RawMemory::ROBData< ROBFragment > ROBData; 
	     )

	  3) method for retrieve ROBData
	      void getROBData(const std::vector<uint32_t>& ids,
                                  std::vector<ROBData>& v) ; 

	 This class is to be implemented for offline, L2, EF env. 
	 Detetor software developers do not need to worry about that. 

  TOOL:  An AlgTool class for converting ROBData into RDO Collection.
         Requirements:
	  1) template class for ROBData
	     This class has to work with ROBData defined in offline and online.
	  2) AlgTool subclass 
	  3) typedef for COLLECTION 
	      (for example: typedef LArRawChannelCollection COLLECTION; )
	  4) a method for converting a vector of ROBData to a Collection.
              StatusCode convert(VROBDATA& r, LArRawChannelCollection*& coll,
			const int* i, MsgStream& log);
	      ( int* i = the int parameters from IOpaqueAddress )


   This scheme divides the Collector converter into a few components, and a 
concrete converter is assembled when a factory entry for the Gaudi Converter 
is  declared. 

For example, in 
LArByteStream/src/RMS/RMS_LArRawChannelCollByteStreamCnv_entries.cxx, 

// ROBData defined in RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc
typedef RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc::ROBData ROBData; 
// Specialized TOOL 
typedef LArRawChannelCollByteStreamTool<ROBData> LARTOOL; 
DECLARE_TOOL_FACTORY( LARTOOL) ; 
// specialized Collection Converter. 
typedef CollectionByteStreamCnv<RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc, LARTOOL> 
			       RMS_LArRawChannelCollByteStreamCnv ;

DECLARE_CONVERTER_FACTORY( RMS_LArRawChannelCollByteStreamCnv );
DECLARE_FACTORY_ENTRIES( RMS_LArByteStream) {
    DECLARE_CONVERTER(RMS_LArRawChannelCollByteStreamCnv )
}

The cmt/requirements is set up in such a way that a separate shared library, 
RMS_LArByteStream, is made for the Collection converter. 

The HLT will provide different ROBDataProviderSvc.  For example, 
LVL2 has L2ROBDataProviderSvc.   There will be correspoding _entries
files for the Collection converter, separate shared library will be 
created.

	The converter for the Container has to be implemented in 
each detector ByteStream converter package, although it is possible in
the future we want to separate the converter into well defined
components and have a common template converter class.  This will
require common interface for mapping the Collection ID to the ROBID. 

	In the meantime, we request the conversion from RDO container to 
the ByteStream be implemented in a AlgTool class. 
See LArByteStream/LArRawChannelContByteStrealTool.h for example. 
The address object for each collection should be registered only once in
createObj() method, with the following StoreGate method, 

	p_storeGate->recordAddress(addr, false);

The second variable (false) is to flag that this address object should
not be deleted by StoreGate every event.
     
-----   Running Athena jobs

      We expect each converter package to provide a jobOptions fragment, 
WriteXyzBS_jobOptions.txt, where Xyz is LAr, SiTracker, etc. 
A top level jobOptions is provided in ByteStreamCnvSvc, 

WriteBS_jobOptions.txt 

which configures the job, and #include converter jobOptions. 
 
WriteXyzBS_jobOptions.txt should define how the RDOs are created, and 
what needs to be written into ByteStream. 

Here is the jobOptions from LArByteStream. 
 
// define how the LArRawChannels are created. 
// ... omitted. 
ApplicationMgr.Dlls += {"LArByteStream", "RMS_LArByteStream" }  ;
// Select types to be written
StreamBS.Itemlist +={"2721#*"} ; 
			  
The CLID number (2721) is the CLID of the Container.  
The RDOs are converted to ByteStream by the Container converters. 

    This will produce a binary file RawEvent.re. 

    Similarly, each converter package is supposed to supply another jobOptions
ReadXyzBS_jobOptions.txt, to be used by ReadBS_jobOptions.txt to test
reading the ByteStream back. 

    Note that the job to write ByteStream file will exit with error if the 
ByteStream file already exist.   Remove the file before running the job. 

----- Example: 

      A working example  is 

LArCalorimeter/LArCnv/LArByteStream

	It provides conversion of the LAr Raw Data Object, LArRawChannel, 
defined in 

LArCalorimeter/LArRawEvent

	The ROD format produced by the current package reflects the
current understanding of the ROD data format. The jobOptions for reading 
and writing and be found in  the share directory of the package. 
    
----- Releases: 

     ByteStreamCnvSvc, ByteStreamData and LArByteStream is released in 3.0.1, 
with the old event format. 

     The packages are modified to use the new eformat package in 
release 4.2.0. 

     In release 4.3.0, we use DataCollection release DC-00-01-00.  This 
is, unfortunately, compiled on Redhat-7.2, while Athena is compiled on Redhat-6.2.
The offline packages compile with this DC release OK, but there is a runtime error.
A temporary fix can be made by defining a symlink in $CMTCONFIG directory of 
your TestRelease,

> ln -sf /usr/local/gcc-alt-2.95.2/lib/libstdc++-3-libc6.1-2-2.10.0.so \
  ../$CMTCONFIG/libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3

	In release 4.5.0 - 5.0.0, eformat is compiled on RH 6.1.  No
special fix is needed. 

	In release 5.0.0, there are converters from Tile, InDet, LAr. 

	The runtime dependency (for using WriteBS_jobOptions.txt and 
ReadBS_jobOptions.txt) is : 

 use LArHitZebraCnv     LArHitZebraCnv-*        LArCalorimeter/LArCnv

----------- Creating Prepared RDOs from Zebra input directly.  Jan ,2003

     To allow the creation of prepared-RDOs from RDOs in one job, i.e,

Zebra -> RDOs -> BS -> Prepared-RDOs

A new  ByteStreamOutputSvc subclass is added, which allows ByteStreamCnvSvc 
to send the output BS to ROBDataProvider.   So in the above sequence, BS is 
held in the RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc.  In addition, the proxy for the
prepared-RDOs are also made.

   A new jobOption is made available in ByteStreamCnvSvc/share, 
PRDO_BS_jobOptions.txt.  This is a top level jobOption that run the job 
for the sequence above.  I.e., the input is ZEBRA, BS is created in memory 
and stored in ROBDataProvider, and LArCells in IDC are created from BS.
All done in the same job.


---------- Splitting classes to  ByteStreamCnvSvcBase   Sept-1 2003

1) ByteStreamCnvSvc package is now split into two package,
ByteStreamCnvSvcBase and ByteStreamCnvSvc.   ByteStreamCnvSvcBase will
only contain the classes needed by L2 in HLT, while ByteStreamCnvSvc
still contains the rest for offline (and probably Event Filter) to read
and write events.

2) A new interface IRODBDataProviderSvc is defined in
ByteStreamCnvSvcBase, as well as concrete implementation
ROBDataProviderSvc.   Currently, the HLT and offline shares the same
implementation, although they are allowed to diverge in the future if
necessary.  This is made possible because we now use the common eformat
fragment types for HLT and offline.

RMS_ROBDataProviderSvc is removed from ByteStreamCnvSvc.

3) The collection converter used to have two template parameters, RDP
and TOOL, now it should only have one template parameter for TOOL.
The AlgTool for the collection conversion has been a template class with
ROBData as a template parameter.  This still works, as ROBData is still
defined in ByteStreamData package. ROBData is still used in the
interface between the CollectioCnv and the CollectionTool.  It is, 
however, not required to implement the CollectionTool as a template 
class.  It can use explicitly the ROBdata class.
