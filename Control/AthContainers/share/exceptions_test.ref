SG::ExcNoAuxStore: Requested aux data item `::foo' (0) but there is no associated aux data store.
SG::ExcNoAuxStore: Requested aux data item `cl::bar' (1) but there is no associated aux data store.
SG::ExcNoAuxStore: Requested aux data item  but there is no associated aux data store.
SG::ExcNoAuxStore: Operation attempted on container with no associated aux data store: op
SG::ExcBadAuxVar: Attempt to retrieve nonexistent aux data item `::foo' (0).
SG::ExcConstAuxData: Non-const operation `someop' performed on const aux data `::foo' (0).
SG::ExcConstAuxData: Non-const operation `otherop' performed on const aux data .
SG::ExcUntrackedSetStore: Attempt to set aux data store on container that doesn't track indices, or disable index tracking for a container with aux data.
SG::ExcBadPrivateStore: Bad use of private store: op
SG::ExcAuxTypeMismatch: Type mismatch for aux variable `::foo' (0); old type is float new type is int
SG::ExcAuxTypeMismatch: Type mismatch for aux variable `cl::bar' (1); old type is float new type is int
SG::ExcInsertionInBaseClass: Attempted to do op on a int base class of float; can only be done on the most-derived class.
SG::ExcStoreLocked: Attempted to modify auxiliary data in a locked store: `::foo' (0)
SG::ExcStoreLocked: Attempted to modify auxiliary data in a locked store: op
SG::ExcNonowningContainer: Attempted to insert a unique_ptr to a non-owning container.
SG::ExcUnknownAuxItem: Unknown aux data item foo
SG::ExcUnknownAuxItem: Unknown aux data item bar::foo
SG::ExcUnknownAuxItem: Unknown aux data item bar::foo (of type int)
SG::ExcDVToELV: Can't convert DataVector to vector of ElementLinks: why
ViewVector not in view mode.
ViewVector intwas used in a context that requires a CLID, but no CLID was available.  Make sure a VIEWVECTOR_CLASS_DEF declaration exists for the class in a library that has been loaded.
Ownership mismatch for insertMove.
SG::ExcAtomicMismatch: Non-atomic access to atomic aux variable  `cl::bar' (1) of type int
SG::ExcInvalidThinningTarget: ThinningHandle target does not exist: 1234/asd
SG::ExcBadIterSwap: Attempt to swap between containers with inconsistent ownership.
SG::ExcAllocOwnership: Bad allocation ownership.
